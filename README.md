# Home Assistant Australian BoM Radar Loop Creator in Docker
Docker container for Home Assistant BoM Radar Loop plus individual radar images to enable use in LLM Vision

The Home Assitant LLM Vision analyser requires separate radar images to process when looking for storm events.

This Docker container creates those images, plus a useful animated GIF for showing on your dashboards. There is also a useful timestamp file for use with an AI prompt to help it understand the BoM image timestamps.

Note that I run this on a Synology NAS so it is set up for that in terms of directories.

Just change `/volume1/docker/bom_radar_downloader` to the path that suits your file system.

## Installation
Create the following directory structure somewhere on the machine where you run Docker:
```
/volume1/docker/bom_radar_downloader/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
├── bom_radar_downloader.py
├── radar_metadata.py
├── config.yaml
├── IDR.legend.0.png
├── home-circle-dark.png
└── images/  (created automatically)
```

Edit the `config.yaml` file to suit your requirements. The intructions are in the file on what to change.

On your Home Assistant create a `images` folder under `/config/www` as per your config file in the `Output Configuration` section.

Then build and run as required by Docker.
